Infolab21 Beamer Theme
----------------------
This theme is an infolab21 styled beamer template, for use with LaTeX.

Thar ain't much more to it than that, folks.



Installation
------------
If you have a linux system (or mac, solaris, etc), and bash, the install script should
work for you.

If not, the installation is a simple matter of copying some stuff into the
correct dir:

1) Locate your beamer themes directory (on my system it's at
    /usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/beamer/themes/
2) Copy the color, outer, theme directories into it.
3) Make the /usr/share/infolab21beamer/images/ directory, and place the images
   in it. (if you don't have that directory, change the path on line 38 of
	   beamerouterthemeinfolab21.sty)
4) run texhash as root to rebuild the latex cache.


Licence
-------
GPL, as per the one I edited to get this version.  You should get a copy of the
license in the distro.  The infolab image used is probably NOT GPL, er, so don't
twist it for your own ends.


Contribution/Hacking
--------------------
If you make any tweaks to the package, could you please send them back to me, so
that everyone can benefit from the wonder your have unleashed.

There's a quick TODO file included if you are stuck for ideas ;-).
